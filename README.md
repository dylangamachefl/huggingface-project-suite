# Hi there, I'm Dylan 👋

I am a results-oriented AI engineer specializing in the design, development, and deployment of **reliable, secure, and auditable autonomous agents.** My expertise moves beyond simple prototypes to building production-ready, enterprise-grade agentic systems.

My primary portfolio, focused on advanced multi-agent systems, can be found on my main GitHub profile.

## 😈 Hugging Face Mini-App Collection

This repository contains a collection of mini-applications I built to demonstrate proficiency with the Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, Inference API, and Spaces).

While my primary work focuses on complex, enterprise-grade agentic systems, these projects showcase my foundational skills in building and deploying a variety of NLP and Computer Vision models.

### Deployed Applications & Source Code

| Project | Description | Live Demo | Source Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Captioning Tool** | An interactive web app that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images using the `transformers` library to run a model locally. | [View Live App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-image-captioning.hf.space) | [View Code](./hf-image-captioning/) |
| **Zero-Shot Classifier**| An interactive web app that classifies text into user-defined categories using Hugging Face's zero-shot models via the Inference API. | [View Live App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-zero-shot-classifier.hf.space) | [View Code](./hf-zero-shot-classifier/) |
| **Text Translation Tool** | An interactive web app that translates text into various languages using the Hugging Face Inference API and Helsinki-NLP models. | [View Live App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-text-translator.hf.space) | [View Code](./hf-text-translator/) |
| **Sentiment Analysis App** | A web application that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided text using the Hugging Face Inference API and a DistilBERT model. | [View Live App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-sentiment-analyzer.hf.space) | [View Code](./hf-sentiment-analyzer/) |
